            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Then Next Gen Talent Show is a Social Enterprise that uses talents and <br /> abilities as a tool to facilitate opportunities for youth employment and <br />engagement
            </p>
           <p>
              It caters to young people from more than 20 countries in Africa that are <br />passionate about any form of talent they've got. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This initiative is just coming to an inception not to show that we are new but <br />for the fact that we understand the concept of nation building and the <br />impact the youths are able to lay, we are creating a platform for African Youth <br /> to leverage on so that they become what they are ambitious of no matter <br />what their background is.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>
             To raise transformational youth Ambassadors for Africa who can break the <br />box and stand out in all continents.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
             We believe that young people can make a sustainable living doing what they<br />love.<br />
              Furthermore, we do not want a continent that does not sustain new talents <br /> we are tired of that. We want to create a platform of support to make the <br />African youth reach their potentials and never settling for the less which is <br />part of the reason why we make it a talent show-competitive!
